# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Interdisciplinary Collaboration
Emphasize collaboration across AI, robotics, biomechanics, cognitive science, neuroscience, systems engineering, and ethics. Define mechanisms for cross-domain knowledge sharing and integrated research workflows.

### Ethical AI Development
Highlight ethical standards centered on human well-being. Address autonomy, privacy, fairness, transparency, accountability, and bias detection. Define rules for responsible data governance and ethical evaluation.

### Robustness & Safety Engineering
Emphasize extreme robustness, resilience, and reliability for real-world operation. Include guidelines for risk assessment, hazard modeling, simulation-based validation, and rigorous testing pipelines.

### Human–Robot Interaction (HRI) Design
Require intuitive, natural, trust-building interaction models. Integrate psychological, social, environmental, and cultural factors. Encourage design patterns that prioritize accessibility and user comfort.

### Continuous Learning & Adaptation
Include principles for systems capable of continuous self-improvement. Specify requirements for real-world learning, feedback loops, adaptive control, and safe online learning.

### Technical Standards
Covering: Hardware-software co-design, High-fidelity simulation, Digital twins, Standardized interfaces, Sensor fusion protocols, Safety compliance frameworks (ISO, robotics safety standards)

## Research & Development Workflow
Defining: Iterative R&D loops, Hypothesis-driven experimentation, Peer review requirements, Knowledge-transfer workflows, Versioning and reproducibility standards

## Governance Updates
Expanding governance to align with the above principles with: Review cycles, Ethical oversight checkpoints, Interdisciplinary advisory board roles, Risk & safety audit processes, Contribution and collaboration guidelines

## Governance
The governance structure for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics projects requires regular review cycles, ethical oversight checkpoints, interdisciplinary advisory board involvement, risk and safety audits, and clear contribution and collaboration guidelines. All development must align with the core principles of interdisciplinary collaboration, ethical AI development, robustness and safety engineering, human-robot interaction design, continuous learning and adaptation, and technical standards compliance.
