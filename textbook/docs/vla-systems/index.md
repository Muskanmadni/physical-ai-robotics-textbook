# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems

This module covers Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, which represent the integration of perception (vision), reasoning (language), and execution (action) in robotic systems. These systems enable robots to understand natural language commands and execute complex tasks in real-world environments.

## Topics Covered

- Vision Models
- Language Models
- Action Planning

This module explores the cutting-edge intersection of computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.
