# Preface

The field of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics represents one of the most exciting frontiers in modern technology, combining artificial intelligence with mechanical systems to create machines that can perceive, reason, and act in physical environments.

This textbook explores the essential concepts, tools, and techniques needed to understand and develop humanoid robotic systems. Through a combination of theoretical foundations and practical applications, we'll examine how AI algorithms can be integrated with robotic platforms to create sophisticated, autonomous systems.

## Target Audience

This textbook is designed for:
- Computer science and engineering students
- Robotics researchers and practitioners
- AI/ML engineers working with physical systems
- Anyone interested in the intersection of AI and robotics

## Prerequisites

Readers should have a basic understanding of:
- Programming concepts (preferably Python)
- Linear algebra and calculus
- Basic robotics concepts
- Machine learning fundamentals

## Approach

We take a hands-on approach, providing practical examples and exercises throughout each module. The textbook includes code examples, simulation exercises, and real-world case studies to reinforce key concepts.

## Technology Stack

Throughout this textbook, we'll be using state-of-the-art tools and frameworks:
- ROS 2 for robot software development
- Gazebo and Unity for simulation
- NVIDIA Isaac for AI-powered robotics
- Modern machine learning frameworks for perception and control

Let's begin our journey into the fascinating world of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
